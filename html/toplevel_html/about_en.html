    <p> The portal provides access to digital editions of the nine oldest Danish hymn books and service
    books with musical notation and texts. Also the first Danish translation of the entire Bible, named
    after the king Christian III, is online here. The online versions
    follow DSL's standard for digital
    scholarly editions. A comprehensive introduction has been written for
    each work.</p>
    <p> Musical notation and texts are displayed together with links to digital facsimiles of the original
    editions, and both can be searched. The notes can be displayed and played in various
    transformations that the user chooses. The melodies are part of a database that provides additional
    historical information, including variants of the individual tunes. All words in the texts can be
    looked up in a newly developed dictionary resource that gives unified access to a wide range of
    dictionaries. It is possible to download both melodies and texts in a
    print friendly version.</p>
    <p>The portal also provides access to a collection of research-based articles that have been compiled on
    the basis of the digital editions.</p>
    <p> The works on the portal are central to the musical and literary heritage of Denmark and
    Norway. Inspired by Martin Luther's thoughts and practices, Danish reformers created a
    divine service in Danish with congregational hymns as a central element. From the late
    1520s until 1573, five hymn books, the core of which is composed of congregational
    hymns, and four service books with the central liturgical melodies and texts are preserved.
    The hymns imprinted the Lutheran view of life on the general population over the
    centuries, carried by the melodies of evocative community singing. Along that way, the
    hymns have helped shape thought patterns, behaviors and
    institutions in today's Danish
    society.  </p>
